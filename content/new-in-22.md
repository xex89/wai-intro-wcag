This page lists the proposed new success criteria in the **Working Draft** of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2.

**It includes quotes from personas (fictional people)** to help you understand some aspects of the success criteria. It also includes links to Understanding documents that explain the success criteria in detail and provide more examples.

## Introduction

For an introduction to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and more about versions 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2, see the [WCAG Overview](/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

WCAG 2.2 is scheduled to be completed and published in 2021. Current drafts:
* [WCAG 2.2 Working Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) is approved to be posted as a draft
* [Editors' Draft of WCAG 2.2](https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/) may have more recent updates that are not yet approved

<em>If you have comments on the WCAG 2.2 Draft:</em> Please submit any comments on the proposed new success criteria **by 4 June 2021**. Ideally open one [new GitHub issue]( https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues/new) per discrete comment. If you’re not comfortable with GitHub, you can send comments to public-agwg-comments@w3.org

### Changes from WCAG 2.1 to WCAG 2.2

All success criteria from 2.0 and 2.1 are included in 2.2. The 2.0 and 2.1 success criteria are exactly the same (verbatim, word-for-word) in 2.2. **One changed level: [2.4.7 Focus Visible](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#focus-visible)** is changed from Level AA in WCAG 2.1 to Level A in WCAG 2.2.

WCAG 2.2 Working Draft provides 9 additional success criteria, that are included on this page.

### Changes to 2.2 Working Draft

Changes from the 11 August 2020 to 11 May 2021 Working Draft include:
* Accessible authentication: Incorporates concepts of ‘steps’ to account for multi-factor authentication, and explicitly allows for ‘mechanisms’ like password managers.
* Dragging movement: A very minor wording update.
* Consistent help: Renamed from “Findable help”, and follows the ‘consistent navigation’ criterion more closely.
* Page Break Navigation: Renamed, the criterion text is reduced to focus on content which already implements programmatic page break locators.
* Focus appearance (minimum): Restructured the criterion text, whilst keeping the requirement essentially the same.
* Focus appearance (enhanced): Aligned with the minimum version.
* Visible control: Renamed (from Hidden controls), added several exceptions.
* Target size (minimum): Renamed (from Pointer target Spacing), reduced the core size requirement to 24px, and simplified the criterion text.
* Redundant entry: Removed the ‘steps in a process’ aspect, added a within-session scope, and added several exceptions.

## Guideline 2.4 Navigable

Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.

### 2.4.11 Focus Appearance (Minimum) (AA)
<blockquote class="sc">

## About the Personas Quotes

The linked persona roles go to the [[Stories of Web Users]](/people-use-web/user-stories/). That page has other personas with different disabilities. We might add more in the future.

We plan to add persona quotes to the Understanding WCAG documents.
